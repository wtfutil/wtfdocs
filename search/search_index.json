And if you're reading this, you know that wtfutil.com now has a blog, and that blog is available via RSS at https://wtfutil.com/blog/index.xml . Putting the two together, you now have a great way to keep up-to-date on the most recent WTF releases, because all of them will be announced, with changlog details, on this very blog. To configure WTF to do so, add the following feedreader configuration to your config.yml file: feedreader: enabled: true feeds: - https://wtfutil.com/blog/index.xml feedLimit: 10 position: top: 2 left: 1 width: 2 height: 1 updateInterval: 14400 Modify the position values accordingly for where you want it to appear onscreen. feedLimit limits the number of stories displayed for any given feed. Without a feed limit, FeedReader will display all the stories returned by the feed.

To execute it, you must now use: wtfutil The name has changed because calling it wtf caused a collision with the venerable and amusing bsd-wtf utility. This wasn't a problem back when there was only one person using WTF and no one else knew about it, but with the rise in popularity this collision has been causing problems for some people. Given that bsd-wtf was created long before WTF, it only seems proper to abdicate the name.
